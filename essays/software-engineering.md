I love software engineering because of my strong interest in algorithms, user experience, and software building. I am interested in Algorithms after taking ICS 311 in Spring 2024, I found that I enjoyed learning about the different types of algorithms and data structures. I liked how elegant and efficient the solution to complex problems could be found using algorithms. My journey began with me having only basic ideas about algorithms. Now I understand more about data arrangements, solving difficult challenges, and how to think through problems. Practicing competitive programming and solving algorithm puzzles has reinforced my interest.

User experience is also quite interesting. The mix of how designers think it should work versus what users expect is very intriguing. Good design changes how users interact with products. Designing websites, like the one I created with hover effects and videos in the background, showed me how important it is to think about users first. I want to know even more about user experience, like drawing design ideas and building early versions of user interfaces. Learning how to match aesthetics with utility is very important to me.

In software development, I am committed to improving my skills across various facets of the field. This includes learning different programming tools like JavaScript for web work and Python for algorithms. I'm interested in learning to manage projects with tools like Git. In the future, I want to use what I know about algorithms and user experience to build real projects. I want to work on projects that use complex algorithms also whilst prioritizing user experience, creating applications that are both powerful and user-friendly. Pursuing internships, contributing to open-source projects, and working on personal projects will be crucial in order to achieve these goals. By expanding my technical expertise and gaining hands-on experience, I aim to become a well-rounded software engineer capable of tackling diverse challenges and contributing to innovative solutions in the field.
