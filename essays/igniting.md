It began on a Sunday, as all great things do. The first destination on my typescript journey was going to FreeCodeCamp and completing their JavaScript and ES6 tutorials. I had a smile on my face and was equipped with a foolhardy confidence in my ability to complete these exercises promptly. I believed I could breeze through these exercises and be familiar with JavaScript within an hour or two. Things did not go to plan. 

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
