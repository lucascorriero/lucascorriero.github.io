Smart Questions are important for smart software engineers because they can significantly affect how questions are answered. Smart questions provide clarity and context for the readers. Smart questions can provide support for others experiencing similar issues. When software engineers utilize Smart Questions, they help accelerate the problem-solving process. One of the ways Smart Questions can help accelerate the problem-solving process is by recording what resources have been already searched for the answer to the question. Some of these resources include archives, google, manuals, and FAQs. By including these details, smart questions also respect the time and knowledge of others, users, and or professionals who could help quicker after knowing what resources were not helpful, it possibly reduces the amount of time it takes to receive an answer.
Shown below is an example of a Not so Smart Question as well as a Smart Question
 
**Source:** <a href="https://readymag.website/4739260">Not so Smart Question</a>
**Summary:** The not-so-smart question asks, “What is the difference between the units of measure px, dip, dp, and sp?” This question is asking for general information about different measurement units used in programming.

****Why This is a Not-So-Smart Question:****
No Mention of Effort: There’s no indication that they’ve looked up this information themselves or tried to understand it on their own first.
  Lack of Context: The question doesn’t say why they need to know the difference between these units or what they are working on. This makes it  harder for people to give useful answers.
  Too Broad: It asks a general question without narrowing it down to a specific problem or use case, which can lead to answers that are too general and not very helpful.


**Source:** <a href="https://readymag.website/4739260">Smart Question</a>

**Summary:** The smart question on StackOverflow is about how to fix the size of a custom font in SwiftUI for iOS 13 and above. The person asking the question has a custom font that changes size with the system's text size settings, but they want it to stay the same size no matter what. They have tried various things and are asking for specific help to turn off this automatic resizing feature.

**Why This is a Smart Question:**
Clear Context: The question provides detailed information about the problem, including the code they’ve tried and what they want to achieve. This helps others understand exactly what’s going wrong and what the user is aiming for.
Specific Details: The person describes the exact version of iOS and SwiftUI they are using. This helps responders give answers that are relevant to that specific setup.
Effort Shown: They mention that they have already tried to find a solution by searching but couldn’t find one. This shows they have put in some effort before asking for help.
