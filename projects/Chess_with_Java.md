The project was to create a playable game using Java. I chose to make chess, I was tasked with the front-end and back-end components of the game. I conducted many tests to check that the system functioned correctly in all scenarios and did not encounter any errors. For each move the player made on the board, the back end had to update the positions of the pieces and then reflect that change in the user interface. The user can select a piece and designate where the piece will go. 

I was the sole developer responsible for the creation of this game. My responsibilities were every aspect of the project: from conceptualizing the game mechanics and coding the game logic to going through rigorous testing and debugging to make sure that the user had a seamless experience. As the only contributor, ensured that both components integrated smoothly and delivered a fully functional chess game.

What I learned the most from this experience was attention to detail, there were a lot of different files and an error in one was difficult to detect. Lots of debugging taught me that I needed to make sure that each component was solid and not overly complicated, because detecting and locating the bug was difficult. This project also gave me further experience with Java.
